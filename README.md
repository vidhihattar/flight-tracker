# Flight Tracker Application

The Flight Tracker application allows users to monitor the status of flights in real-time. Users can track flights, receive notifications about flight updates, and get real-time information via email.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Tracking:**
  - Users can track a flight by clicking a "Track this Flight" button associated with each flight.
